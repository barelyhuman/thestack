# Getting Started

## Using the Template

You've got a few options

- Clone the repository, delete the `.git` folder and then run `git init` to
  start fresh.
- Click the `Use Template` button (make sure you are logged in) on GitHub, if
  you plan to use GitHub for your work.
- Use a git based scaffolding tool

```sh
npx degit barelyhuman/thestack <your-project-name>
```

> **Note**: Replace `<your-project-name>` with the folder/project-name you'd
> like to setup

- Create the basic `.env` file, you can modify values as needed but the
  `.example` comes with dummy values that should help you get started either
  ways

```sh
$ cp .env.example .env
```

## Package Management

You are free to use any package manager but the template comes with `pnpm` as
the preferred package manager. If you do not wish to continue with that then you
can switch to a different one using the following steps.

1. Delete the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file
2. Delete `"packageManager": "pnpm@8.3.1"` from `package.json`.
3. Run the `install` command of your preferred package manager
4. Make sure you add the `lock` file generated by your selected package manager.

```sh
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or whatever else exists at this point
```

## Starting the Server

**Prerequisites**

- Docker and Docker compose installed (if using the app with redis)
  - If you do not plan to use redis then you should also remove the ratelimiter
    code in `app.ts`

If you decided to keep the redis and rate limiter implementation and want to use
a local redis instance then run the following before running the `Dev` or `Prod`
modes

```sh
$ docker compose up # run in foreground
$ docker compose up -d # run the service in the background
```

The scripts to start the server in both dev and prod mode are already in place.

**Dev Mode** (Will watch for changes and restart)

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm run dev
```

**Run/Prod Mode**

```sh
npm run start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm run start
```
